Everything was stable in the world. The Machine, \u000d\u000apervading everywhere across the realm, continued to provide \u000d\u000afor the needs of the populace. This was, after all, the natural \u000d\u000aorder of things.\u000d\u000aBut not everyone was so sure. One day, organic individual CK-57 \u000d\u000abegan exploring the ancient uninhabitable sectors, seeking \u000d\u000aevidence for her doubts. After a few weeks of wandering, she \u000d\u000afound an area that sounded different than the rest, different \u000d\u000athan the usual steady hum of the Machine that had always \u000d\u000apermeated the entire world.\u000d\u000aCK-57 followed the noises to a collapsed passageway.She \u000d\u000agradually cleared the way, and in doing so, rediscovered a region \u000d\u000aof magnificent construction that had been forgotten for \u000d\u000acenturies: the central energy core of the Machine.\u000d\u000aEpisode 1: Unearthing The Core","","","c\u000d\u000aThe Machine\u2019s core sparked a great curiosity in CK-57. Its exact \u000d\u000apurpose was not immediately obvious, but it was of enough \u000d\u000ainterest that her acquantaintances felt compelled to look for \u000d\u000athemselves. \u000d\u000aTogether, they studied the newly discovered area. They \u000d\u000aconfirmed its connection to the greater Machine, and identified it \u000d\u000aas the Machine\u2019s long mysterious central energy source. This \u000d\u000asuggested to them that the ancient myths of the Mechanists \u000d\u000amay in fact have been true: that the Machine is entirely inorganic \u000d\u000aand was a construction of the ancient organics.\u000d\u000aThey established the New Mechanists in order to help recruit \u000d\u000aothers to their cause and to better organize their studies. \u000d\u000aAs they continued their work, they came upon the most shocking \u000d\u000adiscovery of all; they learned that that the Machine sustains \u000d\u000atheir entire world, and that it had begun to break down.\u000d\u000aEpisode 2: Return Of The Mechanists","Episode 3: The Unheeded Prophet\u000d\u000aThe New Mechanists needed help if they were to succeed in \u000d\u000amaintaining the Machine. Some inorganics were available, but \u000d\u000athey were no longer very common and were generally untrusted.\u000d\u000aCK-57 set out to warn the populace of their alarming discovery: \u000d\u000athat the Machine is an artificial construction responsible for \u000d\u000asupplying their air, food, water, and light. She warned that the \u000d\u000aend of all things would soon come if they did not act.\u000d\u000aThe populace took little notice. They were steadfast in their \u000d\u000abelief that their world had always been and always would be. \u000d\u000aDespite repeated attempts, CK-57 was finally forced to accept \u000d\u000athat her message would not be heard. The New Mechanists \u000d\u000awould be on their own in their mission to save the Machine.","","","Dismayed by the lack of attention to their cause, the New \u000d\u000aMechanists attempted to oversee the care of the Machine on \u000d\u000atheir own \u2013 but it was too little too late.\u000d\u000aAt first, signs of the Machine\u2019s degradation were subtle: a brief \u000d\u000aflicker of the lights, or subsistence units arriving slightly behind \u000d\u000aschedule. Some subsystems would cease operation for a time \u000d\u000aand then start back up again. But once these minor breakdowns \u000d\u000abegan, the situation worsened at an exponential rate.\u000d\u000aThe air in some sectors grew stale, and even toxic, as the \u000d\u000afiltration systems failed. Automated farms lost light and water, \u000d\u000aleaving crops to wither away. Some of the deeper sectors, \u000d\u000apreviously kept open through pumping, became flooded. Pipes of \u000d\u000aoverheating coolant began to burst.\u000d\u000aDespite these flashes of chaos, the final moments of the \u000d\u000aMachine were not violent; as it exhaled its final breath, the entire \u000d\u000aworld was plunged into darkness and became filled with a \u000d\u000adeafening silence that had not been heard for millenia. \u000d\u000aEpisode 4: Death Of The Machine","It was just as CK-57 and the other New Mechanists had warned. \u000d\u000aThe Machine was not permanent. Ever since the rise of the \u000d\u000aMechatronic Order centuries prior, the populace had begun to \u000d\u000alose sight of their origins. They invented their own convenient \u000d\u000aexplanations for their world \u2013 and paid the ultimate price.\u000d\u000aNot everyone perished immediately; those with inorganic \u000d\u000aimplants tended to fare a bit better, having fewer biological \u000d\u000aneeds. But without the Machine to provide for them, it was not \u000d\u000along until there was no one left.\u000d\u000aIn the end, the New Mechanists were vindicated \u2013 but this did \u000d\u000alittle to spare their lives.\u000d\u000aEpisode 5: As Foretold","","","But amidst the darkness and silence, some activity still stirred. \u000d\u000aMany of the inorganics endured in the wake of the Machine\u2019s \u000d\u000aend. \u000d\u000aThe majority of inorganics had been programmed by the New \u000d\u000aMechanists with a subroutine for self-preservation, identified as \u000d\u000aMaxim 6B, to be invoked upon determination of the organics\u2019 \u000d\u000aextinction.\u000d\u000aAnd so it was that Maxim 6B came to be invoked. The remaining \u000d\u000ainorganics blindly explored their darkened, silent realm, seeking \u000d\u000aa route to the surface beyond the only world they had ever \u000d\u000aknown.\u000d\u000aWhen they finally emerged, they found a poisoned, dead \u000d\u000alandscape. But they set out nonetheless, off into the endless \u000d\u000adistance, in search of a future of their own.\u000d\u000aEpisode 6: A Bleak Sort Of Hope","Collapse Of The Sightless Age is a concept album that imagines a \u000d\u000afuture history of Earth in which all of humanity is forced underground \u000d\u000afollowing environmental collapse, and is the sequel to Echoes Of The \u000d\u000aMechatronic Age.\u000d\u000aFollowing the fall of the Mechatronic Order, the populace of this \u000d\u000asubterranean world are content to accept the Machine as their \u000d\u000aunequivocal caretaker, so much so that it does not even register to \u000d\u000athem as a machine at all. Rather, it is perceived as the very fabric of \u000d\u000atheir world \u2013 a natural construction that is eternally constant. That is, \u000d\u000aat least until the New Mechanists uncover the truth.\u000d\u000aThe citizenry of this world is comprised of a blend of humans \u000d\u000a(\u201corganics\u201d), robots (\u201cinorganics\u201d), and cybernetic hybrids.\u000d\u000aInfluences for this concept include The Machine Stops by E.
