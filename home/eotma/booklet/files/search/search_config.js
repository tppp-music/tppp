But eventually so too did \u000d\u000aMechatronic Order, along with their rituals and scriptures.\u000d\u000a\u201cThe Machine shall be tended\u201d \u2013 but we have not the means.\u000d\u000aAnd yet onward the Machine continues Its work, billowing Its steam and \u000d\u000aclanging Its gears and flashing Its indicators \u2013 put forth into motion by \u000d\u000asome unknown energy source.\u000d\u000aThe old beliefs of the Order have largely dissipated long ago, but a small \u000d\u000aminority insists that we are very much beholden to the Machine, \u000d\u000aclaiming that It somehow sustains our very existence.\u000d\u000aNo, the Machine shall not be tended. \u000d\u000aTime will tell if It does indeed tend to us.","","","The Mechatronic Order was originally an exclusively organic \u000d\u000aorganization. Inorganics were deemed to lack the cognitive and \u000d\u000adextrous abilities required to properly perform the rituals \u000d\u000aprescribed by the Order.\u000d\u000aBut as the populace grew to gradually question the role and \u000d\u000aimportance of the Order, the overseers struggled to attract new \u000d\u000amembers to their ranks. This drove some overseers to explore \u000d\u000atechnological advancements to allow inorganic overseers to be \u000d\u000aapplied to supplement their dropping numbers.\u000d\u000aMany overseers opposed this idea, claiming that it would \u000d\u000acorrupt the purity of their calling should the inorganics fail to \u000d\u000aperform adequately. But faced with the risk of disappearing \u000d\u000aaltogether, the opposers relented and allowed for inorganic \u000d\u000aoverseers to be assembled.\u000d\u000aEpisode 1: Corruption Of The Order","","","For a time, the Mechanists and Mechatronic Order co-existed. \u000d\u000aBoth sought to attend to the Machine, but for different reasons.\u000d\u000aThe Mechanists were steeped in measurements and empirical \u000d\u000aobservations. But for the Mechatronic Order, it was a matter of \u000d\u000afaith and divine responsibility.\u000d\u000aThe Mechanists felt duty-bound to their ancestors, who had \u000d\u000apassed down their procedures and records. But after so many \u000d\u000agenerations, the truth of these traditions became obscured and \u000d\u000aoriginal records became damaged or lost. Some Mechanists \u000d\u000abegan to question why their maintenance procedures should \u000d\u000acontinue to be executed. For them, the Order provided an answer \u000d\u000a\u2013 but not all were swayed so easily. \u000d\u000aThe last of the Mechanists to remain, determined to carry on the \u000d\u000atraditions unadulterated, needed a little more\u2026 convincing.\u000d\u000aEpisode 2: The Subdued Mechanist","The Mechanists were not the only ones to grow doubtful of their \u000d\u000aworld. \u000d\u000aAfter centuries under the Mechatronic Order, more and more of \u000d\u000athe population were questioning their faith. Many did not believe \u000d\u000athe legends told by the members of the Order. \u000d\u000aSome came to believe that the Machine simply always was and \u000d\u000aalways will be, an eternal state of being with no need for \u000d\u000aexplanation. \u000d\u000aOthers argued against this, feeling that there must be some \u000d\u000areason, some purpose to it all, while also being unsatisfied with \u000d\u000athe vague and inconsistent answers of the Mechatronic Order. \u000d\u000aThis feeling tormented them, but they were powerless to \u000d\u000adiscover the truth.\u000d\u000aEpisode 3: Purpose Of The Machine","","","The Mechatronic Order did succeed in deploying a small number \u000d\u000aof inorganic overseers to supplement their dwindling numbers, \u000d\u000abut there came a time when no more organic overseers \u000d\u000aremained.\u000d\u000aThe inorganic overseers continued the work of their former \u000d\u000aorganic counterparts. However, their programming was not \u000d\u000arobust and, without supervision, they began to make mistakes. \u000d\u000aOne such mistake resulted in the loss of air filtration to an entire \u000d\u000asector of the habitats, and in the subsequent abandonment of \u000d\u000athat sector.\u000d\u000aThe people of the area, believing that the inorganics were \u000d\u000aactively sabotaging the balance of the Machine, hunted down \u000d\u000aand deactivated all remaining inorganic overseers.\u000d\u000aEpisode 4: Fall Of The Last Overseer","Episode 5: Mechatronic Spectre\u000d\u000aAnd then, the Mechatronic Order was no more. Only a spectre of \u000d\u000aits former presence still lingered. \u000d\u000aSome said that the abandoned sectors remained inhabited by \u000d\u000athe souls of overseers. Old relics claimed to be of the \u000d\u000aMechatronic Order were occasionally discovered and brought \u000d\u000aforth \u2013 but as the years passed, many came to doubt if the \u000d\u000aMechatronic Order ever truly existed at all.\u000d\u000aAfter all, the Machine churned on and the world appeared stable \u000d\u000aand secure, as it always had been \u2013 even without the overseers \u000d\u000aand their rituals. \u000d\u000aPerhaps these were all merely tales and stories from a mythical \u000d\u000aepoch \u2013 echoes of an era before time \u2013 now commonly known as \u000d\u000athe Mechatronic Age.","","","Echoes Of The Mechatronic Age is a concept album that imagines a \u000d\u000afuture history of Earth in which all of humanity is forced underground \u000d\u000afollowing environmental collapse. \u000d\u000aIn order to survive underground, a group known as the Mechanists \u000d\u000adevises a massive automated machine to provide fresh air, water, \u000d\u000afood, temperature control, and anything else that people may need. \u000d\u000aThe machine pervades their entire underground habitat, and beyond. \u000d\u000aBut after a few centuries, the science-based approach of the \u000d\u000aMechanists transforms into the religion of the Mechatronic Order, and \u000d\u000aeventually there is no one left that truly understands the origins or \u000d\u000aworkings of their life-sustaining machine. \u000d\u000aThe citizenry of this world is comprised of a blend of humans \u000d\u000a(\u201corganics\u201d), robots (\u201cinorganics\u201d), and cybernetic hybrids.\u000d\u000aInfluences for this concept include The Machine Stops by E. M. Forster, \u000d\u000aIsaac Asimov\u2019s robot stories, and Thief II: The Metal Age.\u000d\u000aAbout","Music composed, produced, and mixed by Eric St-Onge in Winnipeg using \u000d\u000aReason 12 | Music copyright 2024 | Released 2024/02/02\u000d\u000aMusic mastering by Jamie Sitar at Outta Town Sound\u000d\u000aFront cover art illustrated by Wenart Gunadi\u000d\u000aBooklet written and designed by Eric St-Onge \u000d\u000awith images generated using the Stable Diffusion XL v1.0 model"]
